# GoogleAppointmentSlots
A solution to manage workflow involving Google Calendar and Forms
1. An email is sent with a link to an intake Google Form
whenever a student signs up for an appointment slot in Google Calendar.
2. Then, if the student does not complete the Form within a 5 minutes for, their appointment is deleted (freed for others), and a second email is
sent encouraging them to sign up again.
